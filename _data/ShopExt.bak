      "description": "An elven race that calls the ashlands their home. Stories say that the Dunmer were tainted after a great betrayal, leaving them with ash coloured skin and fire coloured eyes. After the eruption of Red Mountain many Dunmer fled their ancestral homeland.\n\nAshlanders are culturally rather distinct from the settled Dunmer, with the primary difference being their clinging to the old ways. The dead are often mummified and buried in elaborate natural caverns, as opposed to being cremated and spread in an ash pit. They worship the Daedra, instead of the Tribunal. They live in nomadic camps, instead of cities. Of course, all these differences have resulted in a rift between the Ashlanders and the Settled Dunmer, causing meetings between the two cultures to often end with hostility.\n\nDunmer, either through a curse or simply adaptation, are relatively resistant to both heat and fire. They suffer no ill effects from breathing in ash, though that doesn't mean they enjoy being outside in an ash storm.",

      "description": "An elven race whose colonies can be found in many places. The Falmer were often thought to be extinct, wiped out after a great war with human settlers.\n\nThe truth is that they were simply lost to time. Many of the Falmer sought refuge amongst the Dwemer, in their vast underground cities. After the dissapearance of the Dwemer, the Falmer were left, entombed, deep underground. They slowly degenerated, becoming a grim reminder of Dwemer ingenuity. For the Dwemer built a tomb that the Falmer could never escape.\n\nThe untainted Falmer sought refuge within forgotten vales, deep within the mountain ranges of the far north. Because of this, the Falmer have been left behind in terms of technology, with most simply wielding spears and bows.\n\nFalmer are highly adapted to the frigid north. They are able to withstand temperatures that would instantly freeze most others, though becuase of this they do not fare particularly well in more moderate temperatures.",
